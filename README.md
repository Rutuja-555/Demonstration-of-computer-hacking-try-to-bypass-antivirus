Demonstration of computer hacking try to bypass antivirus 

	People thought they install anti-virus its means computers were in safe and no way to harm. In Digital world nothing is fully secure. In this demonstration we create computer virus to gain access to computer. Also try to bypass operating system firewall and antivirus. We used Python language to virus which helps us to gain access of victim’s computer using reverse shell.

What is reverse shell?

	A reverse shell works by the remote computer sending its shell to a specific user, rather than binding it to a port, which would be unreachable in many circumstances. This allows root commands over the remote server. Reverse shells are also commonly used for nefarious purposes, like after a hacker roots a server, they will likely make a reverse shell so they have easy access to the computer for future use. Let's take a look at a few ways we could make one on an example remote computer. I trust it is one that you haven't used.

Function:
1.	Virus which gain access of victim’s system using reverse shell.
2.	Bypass windows firewall.
3.	Bypass anti-virus.
4.	Virus which works even computer network break or computer restart.
5.	Gain access to victim’s system and perform various harmful activities for demonstration purpose.
6.	Create real world scenario like virus sent to victim pc using attach virus .exe file to normal document file and sent over email.   
	
Hardware Requirement:
1.	Server machine - attackers 
2.	Windows system - Victim machine.

Software Requirement:
1.	Python 
2.	Network analyzer tools
